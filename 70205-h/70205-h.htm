<p><b>Illustration A</b>—Back view with spokes released.</p>

<p>Hold winder in left hand with flat side toward you. Holding knob between thumb and
fore finger of right hand with thumb at bottom, push thumb to left to turn knob and
release spokes.</p>

<p><b>Illustration B—SINGLE PETAL DAISY WRAPPED OVER 1 SPOKE.</b> With left thumb,
hold yarn across center of winder leaving end extend about 1 inch beyond center. With
right hand, pass yarn from left to right around spoke at top (No. 1); across center of winder
from right to left around spoke directly opposite (No. 2), across center of winder from left
to right around spoke No. 3 at right of 1st spoke wrapped; across center, from right to left
around spoke No. 4 at left of 2nd spoke wrapped; across center, from left to right around
spoke No. 5; across center, from right to left around spoke No. 6; and continue in this way
wrapping each spoke once, always passing across center to wrap spoke opposite, until the
12th spoke is wrapped. Bring yarn across center and cut end about 1 inch beyond center.
MAKE CENTER BEFORE REMOVING DAISY FROM WINDER. See Illustration E.</p>

<p><b>Illustration C—DOUBLE PETAL DAISY WRAPPED OVER 1 SPOKE.</b> With left thumb
hold yarn at center leaving end to extend about 1 inch; with right hand, pass yarn from left
to right around spoke No. 1 at top; across center; from right to left around spoke No. 2
directly opposite, wrap around these 2 spokes once more in same way; across center, from
left to right around spoke No. 3 at right of spoke 1st wrapped; across center, from right
to left around spoke No. 4 at left of 2nd spoke wrapped; wrap these 2 spokes once more;
across center, from left to right around spoke No. 5; from right to left around spoke No. 6;
around these 2 once more; and continue in this way wrapping twice around 2 spokes exactly
opposite then passing on to the next 2, until all spokes are wrapped twice ending with
No. 12; bring yarn across center and cut end about 1 inch beyond center. If a daisy of
more layers of petals is desired, wrap as many times as you desire layers of petals. MAKE
CENTER BEFORE REMOVING DAISY FROM WINDER. See Illustration E.</p>

<p><b>Illustration D—SINGLE PETAL DAISY WRAPPED OVER 2 SPOKES.</b> With left thumb,
hold yarn at center allowing end to extend about 1 inch. With right hand, pass yarn from
left to right around spokes Nos. 1 and 2; across center, from right to left around Nos. 3
and 4; across center, around 5 and 6; across center, around 7 and 8; across center, around
9 and 10; across center, around 11 and 1; across center, around 12 and 3; across center,
around 2 and 5; across center, around 4 and 7; across center, around 6 and 9; across center,
around 8 and 11; across center, around 10 and 12; across center, cut end about 1 inch
beyond center. MAKE CENTER BEFORE REMOVING DAISY FROM WINDER. See
Illustration E.</p>

<p><b>TO MAKE DOUBLE PETAL DAISY WRAPPED OVER 2 SPOKES.</b> Make same as single
petal over 2 spokes, then continue to wrap in same way as many times as desired.</p>

<p><b>Illustration E—Center.</b> Thread needle with yarn for center. Fasten at center of wrong side
of daisy as for embroidery. The side of daisy toward you is the wrong side. Insert needle
under 4 petals, draw yarn through tightly; bring yarn back over the last 3 of these 4 petals,
insert needle under these 3 petals and 1 more making 4 petals in all; draw yarn through,
continue to bring yarn back over 3 petals and draw it under 4 petals each time until you
have made 13 stitches. Be sure there are 13, otherwise your center will not be complete.
As the weaving stitches are worked, be careful to carry around the starting yarn end of
Daisy, taking each weaving stitch over this end for at least 10 stitches so as to fasten it
securely. This is particularly necessary with all the cotton threads. Fasten yarn on wrong
side. Cut off all ends close to center.</p>

<p>Turn knob in opposite direction to draw in spokes and release daisy.</p>

<p><b>Illustration F.</b> Right side of complete daisy.</p>
